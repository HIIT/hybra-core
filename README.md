# Data management and analysis for HYBRA project

The core data management and analysis tools for "Racisms and public communications in the hybrid media environment"-project, funded by Academy of Finland and executed by

* Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT and Department of Computer Science, Aalto Univeristy and University of Helsinki
* Department of Social Research, Univerisity of Helsinki
* School of Communication, Media and Theatre, University of Tampere

We hope that some day, these tools will be more beautiful _ecosystem_ of data analysis in the Hybrid Media Space. For now, we regret to say, this is just bunch of code put together quickly. So, most likely not that much to see yet!

## Getting the data

In project root folder, execute

1. `git submodule add https://username@vcs.hiit.fi/git/hybra-data-test1`
1. In the folder hybra-data-test1, run git pull every now and then

Use your University of Helsinki account.

**Do not do any serious stuff with this data. It is for illustration only.**
