# Toolkit for data management and analysis

This library aims to help social scientists working on their various data management and analysis needs.

## Background

The core data management and analysis tools for "Racisms and public communications in the hybrid media environment"-project, funded by Academy of Finland and executed by

* Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT and Department of Computer Science, Aalto Univeristy and University of Helsinki
* Department of Social Research, Univerisity of Helsinki
* School of Communication, Media and Theatre, University of Tampere

We hope that some day, these tools will be more beautiful _ecosystem_ of data analysis in the Hybrid Media Space. For now, we regret to say, this is just bunch of code put together quickly. So, most likely not that much to see yet!
